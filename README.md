# SHeCoRe - Shell Configuration Restorer

Set of scripts and config files for restoring shell/environment settings.

This tool has been prepared for private purpose so probably is useless for the rest of the world. In case you find it useful please find some short manual in this document.

Currently the scripts provide restoration of following settings:

* bash settings [in progress] - aliases, prompt, environment variables
* directories [in progress] - set of directories one wants to have on each development/personal/work machine
* installed applications [to be done] - automatic application installation (Ubuntu apt and CentOS yum supported)
